Additional Statements of Work will be deemed issued and accepted only if signed by both Parties. Each statement of work, upon execution by both of the parties hereto, will be incorporated into this Agreement (each such executed statement of work, a “Statement of Work” or “SOW”). In the event of any conflict between the terms in this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall govern except when a provision of a SOW expressly states it supersedes this Agreement.

Gofor shall not be responsible in any way for performance of any services listed on such additional Statement(s) of Work until such Statement(s) of Work have been fully executed by both parties, and, until such execution, Gofor shall only be responsible for performance of services expressly set forth on any previously executed Statement(s) of Work. In no event shall expenses for work that have already been incurred under this agreement be refundable. Subject to the foregoing, the manner and means by which Gofor chooses to complete the Services are in Gofor’s sole discretion and control.
